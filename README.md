Personal Repository maintained for Lab-Based Project done as part of course requirements during sixth semester of graduation.

Hopefully, this will be a useful resource in future for RL, DL etc.

This repo has :

- Personal notes by me for personal learning.
- Code contributed by both of us.

Colab Notebooks:

- DDQN : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mCiVdE7P_jX5CSCnnI-QFyVarCZzpuWy?usp=sharing

Work done by both till now for project :

- Studied and implemented value based deep RL algorithms : Deep Q Learning (DQN) and Double Deep Q Learning (DDQN) using Numpy, Keras and Gymnasium libraries.
- Studied in-depth about policy based learning, policy gradients and actor-critic methods.
- Studied and implemented actor-critic RL algorithms : Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) using PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow and Gymnasium libraries.
- Studied basics of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.
- Studied and implemented Multi-Agent Deep SARSA algorithm.
- Studied in-depth about Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG).
- Studied basics of RL, DL, neural networks and Deep RL.

**Future : add codes of maddpg**
